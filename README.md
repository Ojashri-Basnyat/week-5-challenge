Work Day Scheduler 
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events each hour of a working day.
When the user opens the scheduler, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar; time blocks for standard business hours are also present; each time block is color coded to 
present the time of the day, past-present-future; can enter text to the time blocks and save it in local storage; or use the save schedule to save all or reset schedule to start again. 

The scheduler uses moment.js, checks the time of the day and if it is past a certain time, changes the color of the block to grey, if its on time changes the color to red, and if time is remaining it shows as green.
